Batley, Michael (2018): Flower-visiting records for Australian native bees. figshare. Collection. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.3521328.v4

Note that the original data is stored in xls files optimized for presentation (e.g., no repeated bee species, no separate rows for male/female visitation records). The files were manually translated into tsv files and then combined in to ```interactions.tsv```. The original files and their intermediate tsv files are also included in this repository.
